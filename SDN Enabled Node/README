# SDN-Enabled Vehicular Node

## Overview
Real-time communication node supporting dynamic interface switching (CV2X/ITS-G5) and multi-hop forwarding via SDN control. Acts as both endpoint and relay in vehicular networks.

## Key Features
- Dual-mode operation: CV2X and ITS-G5 interfaces
- SDN control: Flow rule processing from controller
- QoS monitoring: Latency/power threshold detection
- Multi-hop forwarding: Wi-Fi Direct fallback paths
- Real-time data extract: PER, CBR, PPS metrics
